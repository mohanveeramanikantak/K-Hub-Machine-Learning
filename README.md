# K-Hub Machine Learning Tasks

Welcome to the **K-Hub Machine Learning** repository! This repo tracks all the ML tasks assigned by our mentors, along with learning resources and solutions completed in **Google Colab**.

## Overview

- **Purpose:**  
  This repository contains Machine Learning tasks given by our **K-Hub mentors**. Each task includes learning resources to help understand and complete it.

- **Workflow:**  
  1. Complete the task in **Google Colab**.  
  2. Upload your Colab notebook (`.ipynb`) directly to this GitHub repository.  
  3. Submit the task in **Google Classroom** if required.
